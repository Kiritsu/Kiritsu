Hello there!

I'm a French software engineer living in Le Havre, Normandy.

I have been programming as a hobby since I was 14.

I mainly use the .NET ecosystem but I'm fine with other tech' aswell. My thing is mostly backend and pure software programming. I also like doing some reverse engineering things and also making scripts to make my life
