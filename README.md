Hello there!

I'm a French software engineering student living in Le Havre, Normandy.

I have been programming as a hobby for more than 7 years now. I have been studying IT in Le Havre, France, for 5 years. This year is my last year of university. 

I mainly use the .NET ecosystem but I'm fine with other tech' aswell. My thing is mostly backend and pure software programming. I also like doing some reverse engineering things and also making scripts to make my life easier.

I really like doing OpenSource. However, with my current life (university + work in a company), I'm not really active anymore and don't really contribute to anything, except when I feel like to.
