Hello there!

I'm a French software engineer living in Le Havre, Normandy.

I have been programming as a hobby since I was 14.

I mainly use the .NET ecosystem but I'm fine with other tech' aswell. My thing is mostly backend and pure software programming. I also like doing some reverse engineering things and also making scripts to make my life easier.

I really like doing OpenSource. I'm not really active anymore and don't really contribute to anything, except when I feel like to. I'm still trying to maintain my own public projects tho... (OsuSharp, UploadR)
